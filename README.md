# Risk assessment training course

This is the content for the risk assessment course. The course content is aimed at users of the [Spyderisk Risk Assessment tool](https://spyderisk.org), but this repository is not. This repository is intended for system administrators who know how to run 
the [Moodle Learning Management System](https://moodle.org). System administrators can clone this repository and then import
the course into their own copy of Moodle.

If you don't want to do that yourself, an instance of the course is freely available online: [Cybersecurity Risk Assessment & Modelling: Core Principles](https://training.spyderisk.org/courses/course/view.php?id=2)

For system administrators Moodle has instructions for [exporting and importing](https://support.skillscommons.org/documentation/Importing-and-Exporting-Files-with-Moodle.pdf) content packages.
